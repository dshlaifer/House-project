1.The picture class draws the picture in a clear and simple way. If I want it in black and white
it instantly turns black and white.

2. the sun2 code

private Circle sun2;

sun2 = new Circle();

sun2.changeColor("yellow");
            sun2.moveHorizontal(-140);
            sun2.moveVertical(-50);
            sun2.changeSize(80);
            sun2.makeVisible();
            drawn = true;
